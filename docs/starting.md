# Getting started

## Building

    $ git clone https://github.com/montilla-marco/marcomarco-private-cloud.git cloud-baseline
    $ cd cloud-baseline/infra-platforms/kubernetes/k8s/kube-adm-install/apple-silicon
    $ ./install-k8s-cluster.sh node_numbers [-auto]

The resulting output is going to print in the CLI

NOTE:Is recommended enable a bridged-network installation with `-auto` option 


## Uninstall Chart

```console
# TODO uninstall script
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
